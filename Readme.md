# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project builds a **Linear Regression** model to predict car prices based on various features. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, removing outliers, and selecting relevant features before training the model.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains information about various car attributes such as price, mileage, year of manufacture, fuel type, etc.
- Missing values and outliers have been handled to improve model accuracy.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing outliers
   - Feature selection
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data visualization using histograms, scatter plots
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Applying **Linear Regression** from `scikit-learn`
4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics used: R-squared score

## Results
- The model provides insights into how different car attributes influence price.
- Performance metrics indicate the modelâ€™s accuracy in predicting unseen car prices.
